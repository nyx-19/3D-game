# 3D-game

My first person, 3-D game involves a drunken player searching about a small house for keys to help them leave. there are items all around the house, most static but some have interactable physics. There is a key counter to tell the player how many they've collected, a prompt at the top to explain the game, a list of objectives, and a timer that will end the game when it runs down. The game ends when you've collected all three keys hidden in the house and walked out the door. While trying to implement a tilt to my camera, I found a problem with the camera going out of control. I panicked at first, but gave me an idea! I actually liked the disorienting aspect, it reminded me a of a drunk person trying to stumble around, so I turned it into my game mechanic. It added a needed challenge to the game to try and get the camera to work for you not against you and it was just plain funny. It's not a bug, it's a ***feature!
